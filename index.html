                    <h3>Graphic and character design intern @HighOn</h3><b>
                        <p>Designed a unique character "ZINKU" a reindeer which acts as an "avatar" for the anonymous
                            customers/ users fo the company, Highon wanted a marketable character ZINKU, as the face of
                            its
                            company and branding<b>
                                <p>Developed the character such that it can be scalable even in the far future, Created
                                    over 250 variations of the character with rigorous planning, sketches</p>
                                <p>Designed 100s of assets(this includes costumes, backgrounds, themes, facial
                                    expressions, a lot more suitable elements) for the character which will give it a
                                    unique look with every
                                    small change in the combinations of the assets</p><br>
                                <p>Complete vectorization of the ZINKU made it animatable and brought it to life.</p>
                                <p>Designed UI elements and icons for the HighOn application</p>
                                <p>This process required knowledge and understanding of NFT art as the base character
                                    ZINKU
                                    will
                                    have the same face value i.e representing the company, but the assets like costumes,
                                    expressions and
                                    many more elements were added as required, for occasions like Indian festivals and
                                    many more
                                    making the users connect with ZINKU</p><br>
                                <p>this entire workflow was carried out in Adobe illustrator and procreate</p>
                                <p>Finally! what any designer wants to hear, the company loved the character a ton and
                                    is
                                    now scaled to an industry level art</p><br>

                    <h3>Partfunds (Startup)</h3>
                    <p>Partfunds is a startup which i was a part of with my fellow friends</p>
                    <p>It is a NFT marketplace, which is why we needed a few of our artworks and characters as a starter
                        to put in the
                        marketplace for onboarding the users</p><br>
                    <p>Designed a logo and planned the complete theme of the characters and vibe it is supposed to give,
                        As the name suggests the ideology behind partfunds was to create a tradeplace where one could
                        sell or buy the NFT part by part (like a piece).
                        In order to represent this, i made the logo which shows the ideology of "part by part" concept,
                        as you can see the the letter P is broken down to small parts which resembles the pieces of NFT
                        that we are try to sell/buy.
                    </p>
                    <p>My way of going about this was to make eye catchy characters and funky art as NFTs generic
                        characteristic is to be unique, this gave me a big field to play with and experiment with unique
                        ideas</p><br>
                    <p>Below are some of the works that i did for the startup,</p>

                    <h3>Myperro (Freelance Branding and Design)</h3>
                    <p>At MyPerro, a company connecting pet owners with pet sitters and offering various pet-related
                        products and services, I played a key role in crafting a brand identity that embodies calmness,
                        kindness, and a departure from typical pet design clichés. To achieve this, I carefully selected
                        colors and themes that aligned with the brand's ethos, and designed a minimalistic logo breaking
                        out from the cliche used "paw" imagery<br>

                    <p>I also extended the brand's identity through various design projects, including:</p><br>

                    <p> - Merchandise: Created trendy and youth-friendly merchandise with playful and funky
                        concepts.<br>
                        - Dashboard and Theme Planning: Developed a cohesive theme and user-friendly dashboards for the
                        company's internal and external platforms.<br>
                        - Corporate Materials: Designed visiting cards and office t-shirts, ensuring a consistent brand
                        experience for employees.</p><br>

                    <p>As a designer of Greenpond, a startup where I collaborated with friends, we focused on providing
                        advertising and freelance services to various clients and small businesses. My role was integral
                        in driving the promotion and growth of these businesses through social media.</p><br>

                    <p>My contributions included:<br>

                        - Design: Designed the logo of Greenpond and created eye-catching posters and digital assets
                        tailored to each client's needs.<br>
                        - Marketing Strategy: Developed innovative themes, concepts, and marketing ideas to ensure the
                        effectiveness of promotional campaigns.<br>
                        - Client Collaboration: Worked closely with clients to deliver designs and concepts that met
                        their
                        expectations and enhanced their brand presence.</p>

                    <h3>Spherebox (Networks and UI intern)</h3>
                    <p>During my internship at Spherebox, I was tasked with redesigning the user interface of
                        DaloRadius, an open-source tool utilized by employees. The tool's design was outdated, so my
                        goal was to modernize its appearance while maintaining the familiar base layout for ease of use.
                        I introduced smooth transitions and revamped the UI using HTML and CSS to create a more
                        contemporary and user-friendly experience.<br>

                    <h3>Personal Artwork</h3>
                    <p>This is my personal art which i have drawn sitting awake with the study lights on, several
                        nights.
                        Everytime i used to sitdown to draw, i used to start by thinking of lines and instances of my
                        life and trying to paint a picture of all those into art.
                    </p>
                    <p>I wanted to show the dark side of emotions through silhouettes, body organs, faces, evil and many
                        more concepts.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>A few of these artworks are posted on instagram and behance, Check them out in the below links,
                        and also switch to dark mode if you are viewing the posts on my insta as it will complement the
                        vibe.</p><br>
